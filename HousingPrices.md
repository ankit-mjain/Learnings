The very first competition of Kaggle i participated in is the Housing Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques. Its been a challenging & learning experience as i have enhanced my understanding of the overall process and concepts behind machine learning.

Currently, i stand at 1042 rank which i dont think is bad, given i am novice at all of this.

The idea is to capture the learnings i have had during this competition and ensure that these can be used in further competitions by myself and others.

Below are the learnings i have had during this time - 
1. Regression assumes that the below are satisfied. Whenever working on a regression problem, ensure that the below assumptions are correct for the dataset being used. If not, then modify the dataset correspondingly to reflect the same.

  1.a) Linear relationship  
  Dependent & independent variables should have a linear relationship between them. Scatter plots can be used to determine       linearity between the variables and to identify outliers if any.
  
  1.b) Multivariate normality  
  Data should be normal before it can used in regression. The easiest way is to plot a histogram to check for normality. If not   normally distributed, then non-linear transformation (log transforamtion) can be used to normalize the data. Histograms can     also be used to identify skewness & kurtosisi in data.
  
  1.c) No or little multicollinearity  
  1.d) No auto-correlation  
  1.e) Homoscedasticity
